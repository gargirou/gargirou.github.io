description: <p><a href="https://malinc.com/" target="_blank">Manufacturing Automation Laboratories Inc.(MALINC)</a> is a R&D company that develops machine/tool optimization software for manufacturing companies. I joined MALINC to help them develop a new company website and to streamline their customer support system. After a few months at the company, we launched the new WordPress website, which was well received by new and returning customers. The website was designed to showcases the company's many products and services. We designed a free resource centre on the website where customers can view MALINC software video guides and tutorials.</p><p>In order to streamline the company's customer support system, I configured <a href="http://osticket.com/" target="_blank">osTicket</a> on the company's web server. osTicket is an open-source support ticket system that centralizes support into one cohesive platform. This system reduced customer support waiting time and increased overall customer satisfaction. I integrated the support system to be accessed through the new website as well as through a module within the company's main software, <a href="http://www.malinc.com/products/cutpro/" target="_blank">CutPro</a>.</p>
