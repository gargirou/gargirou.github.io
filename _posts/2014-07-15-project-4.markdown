description: <a href="https://malinc.com/" target="_blank"/>Manufacturing Automation Laboratories Inc.(MALINC)</a> is a R&D company that develops machine/tool optimization software for manufacturing companies. I joined MALINC to help them develop a new company website and to streamline their customer support system. After a few months at the company, we launched the new WordPress website, which was well received by new and returning customers. The website was designed to showcases the company's many products and services. We designed a free resource centre on the website where customers can view MALINC software video guides and tutorials. <br/>In order to streamline the company's customer support system, I configured <a href="http://osticket.com/" target="_blank"/>osTicket</a> on the company's web server. osTicket is an open-source support ticket system that centralizes support into one cohesive platform. This system reduced the number of support emails sent to employees and reduced the waiting time customers had to wait for a response. I integrated the system to be accessed by the new website as well as in a module through the company's main software, <a href="http://www.malinc.com/products/cutpro/" target="_blank"/>CutPro</a>.
