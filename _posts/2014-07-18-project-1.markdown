description: SLS Express Linen cleans and delivery laundry to a vast number of hotels and restaurants daily. As their business expanded, they needed a modern mobile friendly website to service customer inquiries. I provided them a clean WordPress website where they can showcase their laundry service and products, as well as integrated their company on a variety of social media platforms.<br/> Alongside creating their website, I also provided SLS Express Linen with on-site IT support in order to ensure their computing devices were running smoothly.
