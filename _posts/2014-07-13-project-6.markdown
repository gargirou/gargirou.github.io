description: <p><a href="http://stepsdancecentre.ca/" target="_blank"/>Steps Dance Centre</a> is a dance studio dedicated to teaching children how to dance to a variety of genres. After experiencing complications with managing their website, the owners of Steps Dance Centre contacted me to make them a new modern, more user-friendly website. I happily redesigned their website as well as moved their email and web files to a better quality web server. Not only was I able to make them a new WordPress website, but I was also able to reduce their hosting fees by over 1000%. This allowed the owners to worry less about their website and focus more on dance.</p>
