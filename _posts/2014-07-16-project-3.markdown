description: <p><a href="http://kootenaysmiles.ca/" target="_blank" />Kootenay Smile Studio</a> is a dental studio that offers general and cosmetic dentistry. They contacted me to recreate their website into a more modern, user-friendly space where they can showcase their services. Their dental studio gives off a friendly and welcoming vibe, therefore I decided to design the new website to have the same look and feel of the studio. To accompany the website, I also implemented a "forms" section where patients can submit their dental information. These forms needed to be secure, therefore I implemented the forms using the <a href="https://www.wufoo.com/web-forms/" target="_blank"/>WuFoo Forms</a> service and integrated them into the website.</p> <p>After completing the website, I created a graphical slideshow to be played daily at the studio. The slideshow contained a number of slides highlighting dental services and testimonials. I designed the slideshow to reflect the style of the website, which made the atmosphere of the dental studio, the website, and the slideshow seem as one seamless experience.</p>
